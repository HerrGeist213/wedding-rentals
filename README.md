### The Design
---
**Parallax**
Repurpose a parallax site from a previous project in the class. Ensure that the responsive navbar functions and the hero image button links to a JavaScript-based sortable menu based on the theme of the assignment.

**Sortable Menu**
With standard HTML and CSS aspects, JavaScript does all the heavy lifting on this section of the site. Given that there's a code-along video from freeCodeCamp to assist with the sortable menu, the challenge was not impossible. That is not to say there was no challenge. 
<br><br>

### The Content
---
**Goals & Users**
Generally, the site is designed to attract females between the age of 18 and 55 who need to rent necessities for a wedding. Since the business also has a strong social media presence, links to Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter are also promiment. Finally, the theme of the site is one of simple elegance with a rather neutral color palette. 

**Products & Services**
Blissful Rentals provides a wide array of wedding amenities for rent, along with delivry / set-up and tear-down services to make the big day a lot easier for the customer. There is also a call to engage on social media for potential discounts.

### The Build
---
As previously stated, the design is simple with an elegant palette and theme. It is meant to be easy to use and engaging enough to keep the user interested. The sortable menu helps with this, as well as the landing page with poignant information and a contact form.
<br><br>

### Summary
---
In conclusion, this site should do a fantastic job of selling the products and services displayed on the sortable menu. There many not be a ton of calls to action, but the products speak for themselves, the pricing model is somewhat unique, and the site design is simple, easy to use, and pleasant on the eyes.
